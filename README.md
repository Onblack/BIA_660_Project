Topic Power of Language: Discovering how textual contents lead to crowdfunding success

Goal:Explore how text of discription from start-up projects would pave the way to attract the investors' attention.

Project procedure:
  1. Scraped textual descriptions and non-textual attributes of projects from the Kickstarter website and reserved the
     projects whose state are either ‘success’ or ‘failed.
  2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the correlations and distributions of the attributes.
  3. Exploited the new textual features, such as part of speech, readability score, topic distributions, and TFIDF matrix to
     apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling.
  4. Evaluated the performances of various classification models through time and accuracy as the sample size increases.
  5. Compared the influence of each feature by testing their macro and micro f1 score and finally reach up to 88% precision
     rate when adding all features.
     
     I'm responsible for part 4 & 5.
